  "dvars": "Derivatives of variance (std, vstd, and nstd) indexes the rate of whole-brain BOLD signal change between each pair of consecutive volumes in an fMRI series. DVARS is scaled to make comparisons across scanning protocols possible. Slices with high values indicate more noise (e.g., motion or spiking), and should be excluded/replaced. D = temporal derivative of timecourses. VARS = RMS variance over voxels. See Afyouni, 2018. Low values are better.",

  "icvs": "Intracranial Volume fraction is a summary statistic for CSF, GM, and WM. Beware of outliers.",
  "inu": "Intensity Non-Uniformity (a.k.a. Bias Field) is slow nonanatomic intensity variation in the same tissue over the image. It can result from problems with scanner gradient coils. We collect median and range. A larger range indicates greater RF field inhomogeneity. A small range with a median ~1 is better. Tustison, 2010.",
  "qi1": "Mortamet’s Quality Index 1 identifies the proportion of voxels in the air background with artifacts compared to the total number of voxels in the air background of T1w images. Mortamet, 2009. Low values are better.",

  "snr": "Signal-to-noise ratio is the mean intensity in each tissue (CSF, GM, WM, and total) signal divided by SD of the air background (noise). SNR is important for estimating the statistical power. A higher value indicates a more stable signal over repeated measurements, thus higher reliability of the measure. High values are better.",
